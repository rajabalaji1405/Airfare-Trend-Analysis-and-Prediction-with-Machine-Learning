✅ Performs feature engineering for improved accuracy

✅ Trains multiple ML models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

✅ Accepts user input and predicts future flight fares

✅ (Optional) Streamlit interface for user interaction and price display

✅ Visualization of price trends and model performance

🧱 Tech Stack
✅Backend: Flask (Python 3.x)

✅Frontend: Streamlit (optional enhancement)

✅IDE: VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook

✅Data Format: CSV files (API support planned)

✅Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras

✅Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

✅Libraries Used:pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, keras, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
